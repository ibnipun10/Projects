This is how the game is structured

I have implemented only Human - Human fight
This game can be easily extended to Computer - Human or Computer- Computer fight




Classes Used

CPlayer : Base class
CHuman and CComputer are 2 derieved classes from base class CPlayer
CFactoryPlayer will give type of class object using factory pattern

Game Controller
CController : This is the brain of the game
It controls the game and is a singleton class.

CBoard Class:
This class merely print the board on the screen.





Logic

Controller has a matrix of 3 x 3 
This is set to 0 initialilly

Player A when moves will set that cell to 1
Player B will set the cell to -1

Controller also has an array of Row[3], Col[3], diag1 and diag2

After every move if any of the above arrays value becomes 3 playerA wins and if it becomes -3 player B wins,
Incase all cells are occupied then the game is drawn.
